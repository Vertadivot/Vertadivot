Hello there, I would like to introduce myself.

I am *@Vertadivot* and I am a new web developer. I learnt HTML and CSS, and I am currently learning JS. 
My dream is to become a game developer eventually, I really want to learn C, C# and C++ along with other programming languages like React, Rust, JSON, TS, etc.
